# Small JS Projects

## About
This repository contains a collection of small projects I built while learning **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  
These projects helped me practice **DOM manipulation, event handling, Bootstrap styling, and interactive web development**.

## Projects Included
- **Counter App** – Built with plain JavaScript and DOM manipulation.  
- **Employee App** – Built with JavaScript and DOM, practicing CRUD operations.  
- **Memory Game** – JavaScript-based memory matching game using DOM.  
- **Movie App** – Uses **DOM and Bootstrap** to display movie data and UI components.  
- **Random Quotes Generator** – Shows random quotes using JavaScript logic.

Each project helped me strengthen my **JavaScript fundamentals, frontend skills, and understanding of web development concepts**.

## How to Run
1. Open the project folder in a code editor (like VS Code).  
2. Open the corresponding `index.html` file in a browser.  
3. Interact with the project to see it in action.
